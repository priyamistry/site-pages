    <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Adventure—defined as a daring, exciting or remarkable experience calling for enthusiasm. Being someone who finds great interest in spontaneous trips to local hidden gems, new finds across the state, or simple nature trails, I constantly aim to intertwine an aspect of adventure in all I do. At Drexel University’s LeBow College of Business, I strive to make my five years not only studying Marketing, Technology Innovation Management and Interactive Digital Media, but an adventure of learning and gaining experience.</p>
        <p>Outside of my professional and academic endeavors, I have interests that I enjoy pursuing. Recently, I have been pursuing fitness and healthy eating as part of my regular routine. Not only because it is generally good for you, but also because it challenges you to adjust your schedule and stick to it. Along the same theme of fitness, I enjoy going on spontaneous trips and finding new trails to hike. Further, as I incorporate healthy eating in my routine I also like experimenting in the kitchen and trying to recipes based on food blogs I follow, but with my own twist. As much as I like to explore in the kitchen, I also like to explore within the city and find new hole in the wall restaurants. As I have been a vegetarian my entire life, it's exciting to see what options are starting to become available as trends change.</p>
