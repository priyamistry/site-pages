        <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p class="about">Adventure—defined as a daring, exciting or remarkable experience calling for enthusiasm. Being someone who finds great interest in spontaneous trips to local hidden gems, new finds across the state, or simple nature trails, I constantly aim to intertwine an aspect of adventure in all I do. At Drexel University’s LeBow College of Business, I strive to make my five years not only studying Marketing, Technology Innovation Management and Interactive Digital Media, but an adventure of learning and gaining experience.</p>

            <p class="about">Currently, I am third-year student focusing my creative and technological skills on digital marketing and digital strategy. Through co-op and case competitions, I carry experience in regional field marketing, project management, and customer relationship management. I am constantly looking for opportunities in which I can be challenged and gain knowledge. </p>

            <p class="about">Outside of my professional and academic endeavors, I have several interests that I enjoy pursuing. Recently, I have been pursuing fitness and healthy eating as part of my regular routine. Not only because it is generally good for you, but also because it challenges you physically and mentally, especially to stick to a regular routine. Along the same theme of fitness, I enjoy going on spontaneous trips and finding new trails to hike. Further, as I incorporate healthy eating in my routine I also like experimenting in the kitchen and trying new recipes based on food blogs I follow, but with my own twist. As much as I like to explore in the kitchen, I also like to explore within the city and find new hole in the wall restaurants. Growing up in South Jersey and going to school in Philadelphia, this city has always been my home. There is always something new to explore whether it be restaurants, art exhibits, street fairs, concerts and much more!</p>
